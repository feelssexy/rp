# my personal rich presence script

funzies fact: i probably won't really maintain it

### reasons why i should probably not fill gh servers with this junk

It basically

* is shit
* is messy
* only works on linux
* requires shell utilities to work
* uses too big regex
* ...did i already mention that it's shit and messy?

### things it can probably do

* show my MPD stream when i'm currently playing something
    - song title and author
    - playlist progress
* show my current app by window name and title
    - also resolves the run command in my terminal using retarded commands
* can leak private information
* can leak me watching *interesting stuff*
* can produce conversations when there's actually someone who looks at the RP

> is there anything else i need to add here?
